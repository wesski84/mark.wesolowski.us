            <section>
              <p>The <a href="https://www.dallaszoo.com/">Dallas Zoo</a> and <a href="https://dwazoo.com/">Aquarium</a> are proof positive that you don’t have to travel far to have a great time in
                Texas (unless you hail from El Paso – then this might be a bit of a drive!) Both of these exciting and
                popular destinations are located in the greater DFW area and make a fun, family-friendly day trip for
                anyone hailing from northern Texas to southern Oklahoma.</p>
              <p>The aquarium boasts more than just fish. From the ocelot to the flamingo, the tamarin to the parrot,
                and the tomato frog to the tree kangaroo, you are sure to find an animal to delight the whole family. If
                the ‘main event’ sea-life is more your style, you are definitely in luck! After all, it is an aquarium!
                One of our favorite features was the pot-bellied seahorse, which come in multitude of colors and make
                for a wonderous backdrop to the walk through the aquarium. You can also see a variety of fish, shrimp,
                clams, coral, and starfish.</p>
              <p>When it’s time for a little rest and relaxation, be sure to stop in at the Jungle Café for a warm brownie
                or some Frito Pie! If you are looking for something a little more upscale, I would recommend eighteen-
                O-one, where they have a variety of fares from around the world. Some of their most delicious
                creations include the Canadian crab cakes, the Indonesian wonton shrimp wraps, and an always
                delicious bowl of Daryl’s Famous Corn Chowder!</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, you will have to recreate these amazing dishes via copycat recipes. The zoo does not put
                up recipes next to the tanks (looking at you, Tulsa Zoo!).</p>
              <p>If your quest to see interesting and adorable animals isn’t satisfied at the aquarium, I would highly
                recommend making the trip 10 minutes south to the Dallas Zoo, where you will find a plethora of
                terrestrial creatures that will round out an amazing urban wildlife adventure!</p>
              <p>The zoo has a variety of big animals to get your interest! From hippos to lions, tigers and giraffes there is a creature for everyone. This year, you can even get your fix of prehistoric creatures-the great and mighty dinosaur!</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on who you ask, the dinosaurs have not been reanimated. The zoo has dozens of interactive dinosaur exhibits for all ages. From animatronic dinosaurs you get to control, to fossil digs and
                interactive puzzles for the youngins.</p>
