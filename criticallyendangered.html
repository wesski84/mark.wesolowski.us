          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Varecia variegata</em></p>
          <p>As the name suggests, black and white ruffed lemurs have black and white colored bodies, but these markings differ between individuals. The general pattern is black hands, feet, tail, and facial markings with a patch of white fur on their head. Their eyes are a bright orange or yellow.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent:</strong> Africa (Madigascar)</p>
          <p><strong>Diet:</strong> Like the majority of lemur species, black and white ruffed lemurs are almost exclusively frugivores; which is the term used to define a diet that consists of mostly fruits. They are known to be extremely selective feeders and possess the special ability to suspend from their feet to help them reach fruit on tree branches. They will sometimes eat leaves, seeds, and nectar which they can reach due to their long tongues. One unique ability of these lemurs is the ability to open the tough, fibrous flowers on the native Traveler’s tree get to the nectar inside of the flowers.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild:</strong> Black and white ruffed lemurs typically live in small family groups consisting of two to five individuals, but these small groups can come together to form one large group. These lemurs utilize a series of vocalizations to communicate with one another. These calls can alert group members of nearby threats and/or help others locate a food resource. Ruffed lemurs are thought to be the only primates that build nests for newborns. The average litter size is two or three young, and they will stay in the nest for several days before being carried in the mother’s mouth. </p>

        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/tiger.jpg" alt="Tiger">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Panthera tigris jacksoni</em></p>
          <p>A tiger’s black stripes provide camouflage and are unique to that individual, just like human fingerprints. Their broad shoulders, heavily muscled forelimbs, and sharp, retractable claws aid them in taking down large prey. The thick neck,
            shortened skull, and long canine teeth maximize bite power.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Asia</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Tigers are obligate carnivores, meaning that they must eat meat. They are adapted for eating large prey, mostly eating wild pigs and sambar deer, but can even take down larger prey, such as gaur, water buffalo, rhinos,
            and young elephants. They are opportunistic, however, so they will also eat birds, fish, rodents, amphibians, and reptiles. Here at Reid Park Zoo, they eat ground meat, specifically formulated for zoo carnivores, raw chicken, and cow heart.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Tigers are solitary and identify their own territories by scent marking (using urine and scat) and tree scratches. The size of each tiger’s territory depends on prey availability, and the territory of a male may
            overlap the territories of several females. Tigers often stalk and ambush their prey at night, relying on camouflage and padded paws to capture unsuspecting prey.</p>
