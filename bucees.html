            <section>
              <p>Whenever I have friends or family visit us in Texas, the first place I suggest we go is <a href="https://www.buc-ees.com/index.php">Buc-ee’s</a>. They will
                invariably ask “What’s Buc-ee’s?” and I will take great delight in responding “Oh, it’s a gas station!” In
                reality it is so much more!</p>
              <p>Buc-ee’s was founded in 1982, although their first major travel center/truck stop didn’t open until 2001
                in Luling, Texas. Beyond priding itself on being one of the largest gas stations with a boasted 80-120
                pumps on average, Buc-ee’s also boasts a host of other services. Beyond the expected convenience
                store, they also have:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Full-service deli
                  <ul>
                    <li>BBQ</li>
                    <li>Sandwiches</li>
                    <li>Fresh Kolaches</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Fudgery</li>
                <li>Jerky</li>
                <li>Wine</li>
              </ul>
              <p>And don't forget the kitschy tourist section full of “beaver wear” and branded items ranging
                from lip gloss to t-shirts to travel pillows; a higher-end retail section including Oakley sunglasses, fine art
                and a range of leather products.</p>
              <p>With all of the things to see within this mecca of travel stops, its crowning feature may be the
                bathrooms. They boast having the cleanest bathrooms anywhere, and back it up by having staff
                constantly circulating the spacious (40ish stall) bathrooms and making sure they are always pristine. At
                times of high occupancy, they will install a second employee to direct traffic while the first continues to
                maintain their high standards of cleanliness. My wife rarely wants to stop anywhere else due to this!
                So, despite being exited to bring visitors to a “gas station,” it must be said that Buc-ee’s is so much more
                than that. With multiple locations across the Great State of Texas, you and yours will find one on your
                journey and will never go amiss stopping in for a stretch &amp; a snack!</p>
