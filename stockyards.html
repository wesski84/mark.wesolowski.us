            <section>
              <p>Whenever we have people visiting from out of town, one of our go-to destinations is undoubtedly the
                Fort Worth Stockyards. With its myriad of quaint shops, delicious foods, and live entertainment, this is
                one place that has something for the young and the old!</p>
              <p>Originally a site where livestock could be bought &amp; sold, The Stockyards became a historical district in
                1976. Where livery stables, livestock pens, and meat processing plants once stood, there are now
                dozens of shops, eateries, murals, bars &amp; nightclubs, including the famous Billy Bob’s Texas, a popular
                concert venue for such famous musicians as Willie Nelson, Tanya Tucker, and even the great Lynn
                Anderson!</p>
              <p>The Stockyards are easily accessible by car, although the closer parking usually requires a fee of $10-$15
                dollars (usually with unlimited time allowed for sightseeing), but the parking can fill up quickly during
                the summer months. A great alternative is to travel in via train on the <a href="https://www.grapevinetexasusa.com/grapevine-vintage-railroad/">Grapevine Vintage Railroad</a>, a
                heritage railroad that travels between The Stockyards and historic downtown Grapevine about 25 miles
                away. Grapevine also hosts a gorgeous historic main street which I will cover in my Christmas posting
                later this year.</p>
              <p>Once at the Stockyards, you will find a variety of activities. Near both the parking and the rail, you will
                find the <a href="http://texascowboyhalloffame.org/">Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame</a>, which celebrates a variety of real-life cowboys and girls. It hosts
                many interactive exhibits that are great for the little cowfolk in your life! A little further down the street,
                you will find an old rail tunnel. This is where you will find some of the best ice cream in Texas, as well as
                a high-end tea shop, artesan clothing and some much needed shade for the Texas summer!
                Across the street, you will find another shopping area (blessedly air conditioned) with some surprising
                gems such as Ben Franklin – the cow, not the man!</p>
              <p>Several times a year, rodeos are hosted and you will be able to see modern day auctions, bull riding, and
                a real-life cattle drive! Along the street itself, you can pat a bull, ride in a horse drawn carriage, and
                admire beautiful murals depicting the Stockyards history.</p>
              <p>All in all, The Fort Worth Stockyards are an incredible place to spend a few hours getting a modern taste
                of historic Texas!</p>
