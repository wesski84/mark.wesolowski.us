          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Hylobates lar</em></p>
          <p>Lar gibbons are classified as a lesser ape because they are smaller than other apes. You can tell that lar gibbons are apes and not monkeys because they do not have tails. These gibbons can range in color, usually from a light brown or
            cream
            to dark brown or black, with white hands, a dark face, and white fur ringing the dark part of their face. They have arms that are much longer than their legs, allowing them to brachiate or swing through the trees with ease, using their
            opposable thumbs to grab onto the branches.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Asia</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Lar gibbons–similar to other primates–have a largely frugivorous (fruit) diet that consists primarily of figs. These gibbons will also consume leaves, young shoots, flowers, and the occasional insect.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Many fruit species in these forest areas are dependent on lar gibbons as a means of seed dispersal. Gibbons swallow the seeds in the fruits they eat and then disperse them when they defecate. Lar gibbons
            live in
            groups, but the size of these groups varies depending on altitude. Research suggests that there is a correlation between higher elevation, increased group size, and increased birth rates.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/lion.jpg" alt="Lion">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Panthera leo</em></p>
          <p>The African lion is a large, light brown to brownish-orange cat species with a long, black-tufted tail. Lions are sexually dimorphic, meaning the male and female look different from one another. Adult male lions can have large fluffy
            manes while females do not. These manes serve a few purposes, including to attract females, and to protect the male lion’s vulnerable neck region during a fight.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Africa</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Their prey includes ungulates (hoofed animals) such as antelopes, zebra, and wildebeest. However, lions will eat almost any animal, from rodents to rhinoceros, when given the opportunity. They also scavenge,
            displacing other predators, such as the spotted hyena, from their kills.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Lions are incredibly social creatures, living in groups ranging between 3-30 individuals called “prides.” The pride has a close bond, and separates into smaller groups to hunt for prey. </p>

        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/zebra.jpg" alt="Zebra">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Equus grevyi</em></p>
          <p>Zebras have white coats with black (sometimes brown) stripes with black skin underneath their hair. When zebras run together in a group, their stripes make it hard for predators to pick out one zebra to chase. Zebra stripes are unique to
            each individual. Male zebra are called stallions, females are called mares and their offspring are called foals. All zebra have excellent hearing and eyesight and can run at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Africa</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Zebras are herbivores and feed mostly on grasses, but can also eat the leaves and stems of bushes. This food can be tough on their teeth, so zebra teeth keep growing throughout their lives.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Grevy’s is one of three species of zebra. Each zebra species have different sized stripes. The Grevy’s zebra has the thinnest stripes despite being the largest zebra species, weighing from 770 to 990 pounds
            and measuring up to 5 feet tall. During the dry season, zebra herds migrate to find more food and water. Most species of zebras do not establish a specific territory that they live within, except for the Grevy’s zebra. Grevy’s zebra
            stallions will mark their territories with urine and dung. Mares will then move into the males territory to breed and then will move on with the foals.</p>
