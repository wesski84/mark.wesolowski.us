        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/flamingo.jpg" alt="Flamingo">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Phoenicopterus chilensis</em></p>
          <p>This relatively large bird species is tall (47-57 inches) and slender with deep pink or even red/orange plumage. Secondary and primary wing feathers are black, and the rump, head, and neck of the species typically consists of the darkest shade of pink or red/orange. Their legs and neck are longer – in relation to body size – than any other bird species. Like most flamingo species, females tend to be about 20% smaller than the males.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>South America</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Flamingos feed mostly on invertebrates such as brine flies, shrimps, and mollusks. They get these food items by quickly dabbling their feet in the muddy bottoms of rivers and lakes, especially when wading in shallow water. Sometimes they swim to get their food, and can be seen “upending” (tail feathers in the air, head underwater) like ducks. Food is strained from the water through the inside of the beak, across a system comprised of keratinous plates and tiny hairs called “cilia.”</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>These social birds live in group sizes ranging from pairs to tens of thousands of individuals. During flight, their large flocks cycle through a variety of aerodynamic configurations to help take advantage of the wind. Forming these large group sizes not only serves as a defense against predation but can help encourage mating behavior. During mating season, nests are built into mud mounds from 1-2 feet in height by both the male and female.</p>

        <div class="card-header text-center">Reticulated Giraffe</div>
        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/giraffe.jpg" alt="Giraffe">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em></p>
          <p>Giraffes are the tallest land mammal with long necks and legs. Their necks have 7 vertebrae like most mammals and are linked with ball and socket joints allowing for increased flexibility. Giraffes also have two horn-like structures covered in skin on the tops of their heads, called ossicones, which are used by males to compete for females. Subspecies of giraffes vary in patterns, but all are typically cream colored with darker brown patches aiding in camouflage.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Africa</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Giraffes are herbivorous, feeding on the leaves, fruits, flowers and stems of trees that other African animals are too short to reach. They use their 18 inch, prehensile tongue to eat up to 75 pounds of more than 100 different plant species each day. Giraffe are also ruminants, and will regurgitate food in order to re-chew and digest tough vegetation. Typically, giraffes obtain most of their water from their diet, but can be seen drinking water every 2 or 3 days if it is available.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Giraffes are not territorial and will form loose herds with no permanent members. Newborn calves are able to stand within 20 minutes of birth, and will nurse for one year. Young calves are often prey for carnivores such as lions, hyenas, African wild dogs, and leopards, and female giraffes often stand over their calves to protect them. Male calves will typically leave their herd at three years of age and can form bachelor herds while female giraffes typically remain close by for life. Other herbivores like wildebeest and zebra can also be seen in close proximity to giraffes. As the “watchtowers of the savanna”, the giraffe’s long necks and large eyes provide them with more opportunity to spot predators.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/jaguar.jpg" alt="Jaguar">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Panthera onca</em></p>
          <p>The jaguar is a large felid species and the only extant member of the genus Panthera native to the Americas. As a keystone species it plays an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating prey populations. </p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>South America</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Jaguars are at the top of the food chain and eat over 80 different species. Jaguars stalk and ambush their prey rather than chasing it. If food is scarce, jaguars will travel a great distance to hunt tapir, cattle, and deer.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>The jaguar is the largest native cat species of the New World and the third largest in the world. This spotted cat closely resembles the leopard, but is usually larger and sturdier. It ranges across a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred habitat is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest, swamps and wooded regions. The jaguar enjoys swimming and is largely solitary.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Lutra maculicollis</em></p>
          <p>Spotted-necked otters range in color from chocolate brown to reddish brown, with blotches of white along the chest and neck. They have dense, water repellent fur, and fully webbed front and back paws with sharp claws. They have small but sharp teeth.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Africa</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>A large portion of this species’ diet consists of fish, with cichlids, barbell, and catfish being favorites. Spotted-necked otters can also consume crabs, insects, and frogs when fish are scarce.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Spotted-necked otters are found near lakes, rivers, and swamps with dense vegetation coverage. They are mainly diurnal and spend nights in dense vegetation, rock cavities, or dens dug in the shore bank. They are not territorial and can be found in groups of up to 20 individuals, though they typically hunt on their own.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Ceratotherium simum</em></p>
          <p>White rhinos are also known as the square-lipped rhino because of their broad lips used for grazing.  They can be distinguished from other rhino species by their long skull and more pronounced shoulder hump. White rhinos have two horns with the front horn averaging two feet in length. Rhinos belong to the perissodactyla, or odd-toed ungulate, family, having three toes per foot.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Africa</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>The wide lips of the white rhino are adapted for grazing on large quantities of grasses. Rhinos identify their food using their sense of smell as they have poor eyesight. </p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Considered the most sociable of the five rhino species, females are typically seen with their most recent offspring. Occasional groups of up to 14 individuals can be observed, but these groupings are often temporary. Dominant males are solitary and will only tolerate females and sub-adults in their territory.  Males mark their territory by defecating on dung piles, spraying urine, and using their feet and horns to mark plants. Breeding occurs year round, with mating rituals lasting one to three weeks. After a 16 month gestation, one calf is born. Calves are very active and are weaned about two years after birth.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/tortoise.jpg" alt="Tortoise">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Geochelone gigantea</em></p>
          <p>Aldabra tortoises are the second largest land tortoise. They have a thick, domed carapace (upper part of the shell) that is dark grey to black in color. Their limbs are thick and covered in scales, and they have a small, pointed head. Aldabra tortoises do not have teeth, but instead use their beak to tear apart their food.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Africa</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Aldabra tortoises are mainly herbivorous, eating lots of vegetation. However they can supplement their diet with carrion, or the decaying flesh of animals. At the Zoo, the tortoises eat lots of produce like collard greens, kale, and carrots, as well as browse and hay. As a treat, the Aldabra tortoises can eat watermelon, cantaloupe, and pumpkin.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Endemic to the islands of Aldabra off the coast of Africa, these tortoises can live in a variety of habitats from swampy mangrove and scrub, to grassy plains. They are the main consumers of vegetation on the island chain and spread the seeds of the fruit they have eaten. They also are known to knock down small trees and make pathways within the forests for other animals. Aldabra tortoises reach maturity around 25 years of age and have a breeding season of February through May. They can lay up to 25 eggs at a time, only half of which are typically fertile. Eggs laid in cooler weather will take longer to hatch than those laid in warmer weather.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="img/elephant.jpg" alt="Elephant">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Loxodonta africana</em></p>
          <p>African elephants are the largest living terrestrial mammal. They are a dull, brownish-grey color, and sparsely covered in black, bristle-like hairs. Their wrinkled skin and large ears increase surface area, keeping their body cool. Both males and females have tusks, or modified incisors, that grow throughout their lives; they also have a modified upper lip and nose – the trunk – that has 2 prehensile finger-like lips at the end, used for grasping small and large items.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>Africa</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>The diet varies during the wet and dry seasons of Africa. When water is plentiful, elephants will eat grasses, leaves, fruits, and flowers. In times of drought, elephants feed on the woody parts of trees and shrubs. An adult elephant can eat 160 kilograms (350 pounds) of food a day! At Reid Park Zoo, our elephants are given a mix of hay, browse, pellets, and a variety of fruits and vegetables.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Elephants are highly social creatures, and live in groups called herds. Herds consist of the matriarch – the oldest female – related females, and their offspring. Males, or bull elephants, will live with the herd until sexual maturity, at which time they leave and form bachelor herds or live alone.  Elephants are also highly vocal. They can use subsonic grumbles heard 8 kilometers away, loud trumpets, and high pitched squeaks to communicate. Elephants are a keystone species; they are instrumental in keeping the savannas from turning into woodlands by knocking over trees and spreading seeds of the fruit they eat.</p>
