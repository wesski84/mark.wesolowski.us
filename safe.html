          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Hydrochaerus hydrochaeris</em></p>
          <p>Capybaras are the largest members of the rodent family and share similar characteristics to their smaller relatives like squirrels and mice. The most notable of these features are their large front teeth, which will continuously grow
            throughout their lifetime. Capybaras use these teeth for grazing on water plants and grasses.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>South America</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>Capybara diets change depending on whether it is a dry or wet season. During the dry season, capybaras will eat reeds, grains, melons, and squashes. During the wet season, they will eat fresh grasses and water
            plants. An adult capybara is able to eat six to eight pounds of grass per day. Sometimes, they will eat their own feces in order to get bacteria into their stomachs to help break down fibers. Three to six plant species comprise 75% of
            their wild diet.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>Capybaras are well adapted for life near the water and depend on it. Just like a hippopotamus, a capybaras eyes, ears, and nostrils are located near the top of their heads, so they can be submerged in water.
            Capybaras will hide from predators in the water and can hold their breath for up to five minutes. Their toes are slightly webbed to swim through the water with ease.</p>

          <p><strong>Scientific Name: </strong><em>Lama glama</em></p>
          <p>The llama is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era. A full-grown llama can reach a height of 5 ft 7 in to 5 ft 11 in at the top of the head, and can
            weigh between 290 and 440 lb.</p>
          <p><strong>Continent: </strong>South America</p>
          <p><strong>Diet: </strong>An adult llama will eat 10 to 12 pounds of grass, hay, corn silage, alfalfa, and grass roots. Llamas usually don't drink as much water as other mammals, but they will drink up to 3 gallons of water a day.</p>
          <p><strong>In the Wild: </strong>The guanaco (<em>Lama guanicoe</em>) is a wild species of camelid native to South America which is closely related to the llama.</p>
